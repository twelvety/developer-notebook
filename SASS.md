# SASS

https://sass-lang.com/guide/

> Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (`.scss`) is used most commonly. Itâ€™s a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The indented syntax (`.sass`) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in both syntaxes.
